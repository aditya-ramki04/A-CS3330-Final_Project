# A-CS3330-Final_Project
Our final project is a Pacman simulation game. We had a JFrame maven project that had 4 ghosts: Pink, Cyan, Orange, and Red with a Pacman that traverse through the map. Pacman takes in user input with the arrow keys to traverse through the maze, and the goal is to avoid all the ghosts, consume all the pellets, powerups, and cherry bonus. The game has customized audio, pause/resume features, and the 4 pillars of Java. The group members are Nitin Chava, Aditya Ramakrishnan, Abhinav Pasupuleti, and Matthew Robison. 

In order to play, run the GameBoard class and click the start screen. Then start moving with the arrow keys, avoid the ghost and consume all the food. Good luck and have fun!
